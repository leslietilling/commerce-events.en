# Transforming data into value with MBI

By now most businesses understand how important it is to collect and analyze data to enhance a customer's shopping experience and inform strategic business decisions. In order to harness your data's true value, you need the ability to centralize and manage data which can sometimes be a challenge.

In this webinar we discuss how you can get the most out of your commerce data using Magento Business Intelligence (MBI). MBI is a cloud-based data management and analytics platform which provides you with the ability to easily consolidate and manage your data sources, model your data, create charts and reports, and maintain a single source of truth.

You will hear from Daniel Rios (Senior Manager, Product Management) who will be covering the following topics:

 * Transforming data into value
 * Building a strong data foundation
 * Combining MBI and Analytics data

You will also see a live demo of the platform to bring these concepts to life.

MBI simplifies reporting with dashboards displaying everything from average order value to customer lifetime value and retention rates. With these powerful insights, you can be empowered to take action and drive incremental value for your online business.
