# Holiday Readiness with MBI

Use your eCommerce data for success during the holiday season. This webinar highlights some common seasonal analysis use cases and methods to address them using key MBI features, including:

- Avoid stock-outs by building a new inventory tracking report and sending daily updates via email summary
- Determine the impact of your sales strategy adjustments this year by creating a report on year-over-year performance around a key date (such as Black Friday), using calculated columns
- React quickly to notable changes in your store's holiday performance across multiple KPIs, by combining existing and new reports into a centralized Holiday Reporting dashboard
